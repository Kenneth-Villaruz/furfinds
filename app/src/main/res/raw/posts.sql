(10,"Are dogs loyal?😍<br><br>Dogs are often considered to be loyal animals, but what does loyalty mean to them? Here are some of the ways dogs express their loyalty:<br><br>
📌 They prefer one person over another. Dogs may have a favorite human who they spend more time with, cuddle with, or follow around. This could be motivated by love, which is an emotion that dogs can experience, or by the rewards they get from pleasing their favorite human, such as treats, toys, or attention.<br><br>📌 They respond appropriately to cues. Dogs learn from their owners how to behave in different situations and environments. They also learn how to communicate with humans through body language and vocalizations. Dogs that are well-trained and socialized are more likely to obey commands and follow rules than dogs that are not.","loyals.png",'2023-12-04 07:28:53',1);
